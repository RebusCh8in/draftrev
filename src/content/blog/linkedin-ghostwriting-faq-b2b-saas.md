You've got questions about LinkedIn ghostwriting. Here are the answers, based on real experience ghostwriting for B2B SaaS CEOs selling $30K+ ACV deals.

Straight answers. No sales pitch.

## What does a LinkedIn ghostwriter actually do?

A LinkedIn ghostwriter writes LinkedIn posts that sound exactly like the CEO. The process starts with voice extraction: deep conversations to capture how the founder actually thinks and talks about their market, product, and customers. From there, the ghostwriter develops content strategy tied to business goals, writes posts, gets CEO approval, and publishes on a consistent schedule.

The best ghostwriters don't write *for* you. They write *as* you. The audience should never be able to tell the difference.

A good LinkedIn ghostwriter also tracks performance: pipeline outcomes like demos booked, signups captured, and webinar registrations driven, alongside impressions and audience growth.

## How much does a LinkedIn ghostwriter cost?

LinkedIn ghostwriting for B2B SaaS CEOs typically costs between $2,000 and $10,000 per month. Pricing varies based on post frequency, strategy depth, and whether the ghostwriter specializes in your industry. Premium ghostwriters with SaaS expertise and pipeline-focused methodology tend to charge $3,000 to $10,000 per month. Agencies that bundle ghostwriting with other services can run higher.

Here's how the market breaks down:

| Tier | Monthly Cost | What You Get |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Budget freelancer | $500 - $1,500 | Generic posts, limited strategy, no pipeline tracking |
| Mid-range ghostwriter | $2,000 - $4,000 | Decent writing, some strategy, basic reporting |
| Premium SaaS specialist | $3,000 - $10,000 | Voice extraction, pipeline-focused strategy, performance tracking |
| Full-service agency | $5,000 - $10,000+ | Team model, multiple content types, broader scope |

The question isn't what it costs. It's what one qualified demo is worth. If your ACV is $30K+ and a single Draft post has booked 15 demos, the ROI math is straightforward.

## Is LinkedIn ghostwriting worth it for B2B SaaS CEOs?

LinkedIn ghostwriting is worth it for B2B SaaS CEOs who sell high-ACV deals ($30K+), know LinkedIn matters for pipeline, but can't consistently find time to write. One high-quality post per week builds more trust and pipeline than sporadic posting. At Draft, a single post has generated 300+ comments, 20,000 to 100,000 impressions, and booked 15 demos. At $30K ACV, that's $450K in potential pipeline from one piece of content.

It's not worth it if:

- **Your ACV is under $10K.** The unit economics don't justify the investment. Focus on PLG or automated outbound.
- **You want to "build a personal brand" for its own sake.** Ghostwriting works best when tied to pipeline goals, with impressions and audience growth supporting the strategy.
- **You're not willing to invest in quality.** Draft generates demos in week one. But that requires real voice extraction and a strategy tied to business outcomes, not cheap content. No other ghostwriter does that.

## How is LinkedIn ghostwriting different from a content agency?

A LinkedIn ghostwriter captures one person's voice and writes as that person. A content agency produces content for your brand account, blog, or multiple channels. The difference matters because founder-led content outperforms brand content on LinkedIn by 5-10x in engagement, and that engagement converts to pipeline at a much higher rate.

| | Ghostwriter | Content Agency |
|---|---|---|
| Writes as | The CEO personally | The company brand |
| Voice | Extracted from real conversations | Brand guidelines template |
| Focus | One channel, done exceptionally well | Multiple channels, spread thin |
| Engagement | Draft clients see 20,000 - 100,000 impressions per post | Typically 500 - 2,000 per brand post |
| Pipeline | Directly attributed to CEO content | Harder to attribute |
| CEO time | Minimal (Draft handles voice extraction independently) | Varies, often more |

People buy from people. In B2B SaaS, your prospects want to hear from the CEO, not the brand account. They want to know how you think about the problem your product solves.

## What should a B2B SaaS CEO post on LinkedIn?

The best LinkedIn content for B2B SaaS CEOs falls into four categories, all tied to pipeline outcomes:

**1. Contrarian market takes.** Challenge conventional wisdom in your industry. These posts generate the highest engagement because they make decision-makers stop scrolling and form an opinion. Example: "Everyone says outbound is dead. Here's why it's actually the best time to do cold email, if your CEO has a LinkedIn presence backing it up."

**2. Behind-the-curtain stories.** Share real decisions, real numbers, real mistakes. Buyers trust founders who are transparent about what's working and what isn't. These posts build the trust that shortens sales cycles.

**3. Framework posts.** Package your unique approach into a repeatable framework. If you've figured out something about your market that others haven't, turn it into a 5-step process. These get saved and shared more than any other format.

**4. Customer insight posts.** Share patterns you're seeing across your customer base without naming names. "After working with 40 fintech companies, here's the one thing that separates the ones growing 3x from the ones stuck at flat." These position you as the expert who sees what buyers can't.

Every post should be engineered around a specific business outcome: demos booked, signups captured, pipeline generated. Impressions and follower growth matter too, but pipeline leads. (For the full framework, read [How to Book Demos from LinkedIn Posts](/blog/how-to-book-demos-from-linkedin/).)

## Why do CEOs need a LinkedIn presence?

B2B SaaS CEOs need a LinkedIn presence because their prospects check LinkedIn before every sales conversation. Every cold email your SDRs send, every demo request that comes in, the buyer checks the CEO's profile first. If it's empty or full of generic corporate content, you've lost trust before the call starts.

The data backs this up:

- Decision-makers spend time on LinkedIn daily. It's where B2B buying decisions start.
- Founder-led content generates 5-10x more engagement than brand content on LinkedIn.
- At Draft, a single CEO post generates 125x more engagement than the average LinkedIn post.
- One Draft post has booked 15 demos, filled a 623-person webinar, and driven 200+ product signups.

LinkedIn is also the only organic channel for B2B SaaS that compounds. Ads stop the moment you stop paying. But post 50 builds on the audience that post 1 created. Every week your CEO shows up with something worth reading, the pipeline compounds.

## How do you convert LinkedIn engagement into actual demos?

Converting LinkedIn engagement into demos requires engineering every post around a specific business outcome before writing a single word. The framework has three parts:

**Target the right audience, not the biggest one.** A post that gets 50 comments from your ICP is worth more than one that gets 500 comments from random people. Write for the 200 decision-makers who can actually buy, not the 200,000 who will never become customers.

**Use strategic CTAs that feel natural.** The best LinkedIn CTAs don't say "book a demo." They say "DM me and I'll send you the framework" or "comment 'pipeline' and I'll share the case study." This creates a conversation, not a pitch.

**Follow up within 24 hours.** Every comment from an ICP-fit prospect gets a thoughtful reply and, when appropriate, a DM. The post is the top of funnel. The DM is where pipeline happens.

The full playbook is here: [How to Book Demos from LinkedIn Posts](/blog/how-to-book-demos-from-linkedin/)

## How long until LinkedIn ghostwriting generates pipeline?

Most ghostwriters tell you to wait 90 days. Draft books demos in week one. No other ghostwriter does that. Here's what the timeline looks like with Draft:

| Timeline | What Happens |
|----------|-------------|
| Week 1 | First post goes live. Demos booked. Inbound DMs from ICP-fit prospects. Engagement explodes. |
| Weeks 2-4 | Posts reaching 20,000+ impressions. New ICP-fit people following. Prospects mention posts on sales calls. Pipeline building. |
| Month 2+ | Pipeline compounds. SDR outbound converts better because prospects already trust the CEO. Every post builds on the audience the last one created. |
| Month 3+ | LinkedIn is a consistent, predictable pipeline source. The CEO's authority compounds with every publish. |

The key word is *quality*. One exceptional post per week beats five forgettable ones. Draft engineers every post for pipeline from day one.

## How much time does a CEO need to spend on ghostwritten LinkedIn content?

With the right ghostwriter, almost none. At Draft, the ghostwriter handles voice extraction independently. You approve drafts (2-3 minutes each, most CEOs do this from their phone between meetings) and that's it. No lengthy calls. No homework.

Compare that to writing your own posts: 2-4 hours per post, every week, indefinitely. That's 8-16 hours per month of CEO time that could be spent on product, customers, or fundraising.

## How do you measure LinkedIn ROI for B2B SaaS?

Measure LinkedIn ROI starting with pipeline dollars, then layer in impressions and audience growth. The framework is straightforward:

**Track three numbers:**
1. **Demos booked** that originated from or were influenced by LinkedIn content
2. **Pipeline value** of those opportunities (ACV x number of opportunities)
3. **Revenue closed** from LinkedIn-sourced or LinkedIn-influenced deals

**Attribution methods:**
- Ask every demo: "How did you hear about us?" (simple but effective)
- Track DM-to-demo conversions (direct attribution)
- Monitor whether prospects mention LinkedIn content on sales calls (influence attribution)
- Use UTM parameters on any links shared in posts

The full measurement framework is here: [How to Measure LinkedIn ROI for B2B SaaS](/blog/how-to-measure-linkedin-roi-b2b-saas/)

**What "good" looks like:** If you're spending $4,000 per month on ghostwriting and your ACV is $30K, you need to close roughly 1.5 deals per year from LinkedIn to break even. Most CEOs with consistent, pipeline-focused content close far more than that.

## Can AI replace a LinkedIn ghostwriter?

AI can generate a LinkedIn post in seconds. It cannot extract the founder-level insight that makes buyers stop scrolling. It cannot read the market and know which angle will drive demos this week versus next month. And your audience can smell AI-generated content. That's the fastest way to destroy a CEO's credibility on the platform.

Where AI falls short for CEO content:

- **No original insight.** AI remixes existing content. CEOs need to share perspectives that don't exist anywhere else.
- **No voice fidelity.** AI writes in AI voice. A good ghostwriter writes in your voice, with your cadence, your opinions, your personality.
- **No strategic intent.** AI doesn't know your pipeline goals, your ICP, or which topics drive demos versus which just get likes.
- **Detection is getting easier.** Both humans and algorithms are getting better at spotting AI content. The risk to CEO credibility is real and growing.

AI is a useful drafting tool for a ghostwriter. It's not a replacement for one. The best ghostwriters use AI to accelerate research and brainstorming, then apply human judgment, strategic thinking, and voice fidelity to create something worth reading.
