Most LinkedIn strategy advice is written for solopreneurs trying to sell $97 courses. It's about hooks, engagement pods, and posting five times a day.

That advice is useless for you. You're a B2B SaaS CEO selling $30K+ ACV deals to a specific buyer persona. You don't need 100,000 followers. You need 50 of the right people to trust you enough to take a call.

This is the playbook for that.

## Why LinkedIn is your best pipeline channel

Before we get into tactics, here's why this matters more than most CEOs realize:

**Your prospects are already there.** LinkedIn has over 1 billion members. More importantly, it's where B2B decision-makers spend time during the workday. They're not on Instagram or TikTok evaluating enterprise software. They're on LinkedIn.

**Trust transfers to your product.** When a VP of Engineering reads your post about a problem they're actively dealing with, and your take is sharp and specific, they start trusting you before they ever see a demo. That trust shortens your sales cycle dramatically.

**It makes every other channel work better.** Cold emails convert higher when the prospect has seen your name in their feed. Conference conversations go deeper when they've been reading your posts. Investor meetings go smoother when your thought leadership is visible. LinkedIn isn't a standalone channel. It's a multiplier.

**The compounding is real.** Each post builds on the last. Your first post reaches 500 people. Three months later, the same quality post reaches 20,000. Six months in, you're generating 300+ comments and booking demos from a single weekly post. No other channel compounds like this.

## The strategy (it's simpler than you think)

Here's the entire playbook in four parts.

### Part 1: Define your one reader

Not your "target audience." One specific person.

Write down:
- Their exact title (VP of Engineering at a Series B SaaS company)
- Their company size (50-200 employees)
- Their biggest problem this quarter (can't hire fast enough, pipeline is flat, board pressure on efficiency)
- What they've already tried that didn't work (hired an agency, ran LinkedIn ads, had the marketing team post for them)

Everything you post should be written as if you're talking directly to this person over coffee. When you write for one reader, everyone who matches that profile feels like you're speaking to them personally.

### Part 2: Pick your three topics

You don't need a content calendar with 47 content pillars. You need three topics you can write about with genuine authority:

**Topic 1: Your market.** What's changing in your industry? What do most people get wrong? What do you see that others don't? This establishes you as someone who deeply understands the space.

**Topic 2: Your buyers' problems.** Not your product features. The actual problems your buyers deal with daily. Write about those problems with specificity. Show that you understand their world better than they expect a vendor to.

**Topic 3: Your results.** What happens when companies work with you or use your product? Specific outcomes, specific numbers. Not "we help companies grow." Instead: "We helped a Series B fintech company book 15 demos from a single LinkedIn post."

Rotate between these three. That's it. No need for motivational quotes, hot takes about remote work, or personal stories about your morning routine (unless they directly tie back to one of these three).

### Part 3: Write one post per week

Not three. Not five. One.

Here's why: one exceptional post that makes your ICP stop scrolling is worth more than five that blend into the noise. The algorithm doesn't reward volume. It rewards engagement depth. A post that generates 300+ substantive comments will reach far more people than five posts that each get 20 likes.

The math is simple (and we break it down further in [impressions vs pipeline](/blog/linkedin-impressions-vs-pipeline/)):
- One post per week = 4 posts per month
- Each post reaching 20,000 to 100,000 impressions
- Each post targeting your specific ICP
- Comments, saves, and shares compounding your reach over time

Your one post should follow this structure:

**Open with a specific, relatable moment.** Not a generic statement. A scenario your reader has lived through. "Your board asked about pipeline this morning. You didn't have a good answer." That's a hook.

**Deliver one clear insight.** Not five tips. Not a listicle. One idea, explored with enough depth that the reader learns something. The insight should challenge a common assumption or provide a framework they can use immediately.

**End with a reason to engage.** Not "like and share." A question that invites their perspective. An offer to share more detail via DM. Something that opens a conversation.

### Part 4: Follow up like it's your job

The post is the top of the funnel. The follow-up is where pipeline happens.

After every post:

- **Reply to every comment from your ICP.** Not "thanks!" A real reply that continues the conversation. This is a public signal that you're engaged and accessible.
- **DM anyone in your target persona who engaged.** Keep it natural. "Hey, saw your comment about [specific thing]. We've been seeing the same thing with our clients. Would love to hear more about how you're thinking about it."
- **Check profile views.** LinkedIn shows you who viewed your profile in the last 90 days. After a strong post, this list is a goldmine. Connect with anyone who fits your ICP.
- **Comment on your prospects' posts.** Don't just broadcast. Show up in their world too. Thoughtful comments on their content build familiarity before you ever pitch.

This follow-up work takes 15-20 minutes per day in the days after your post goes live. It's where demos get booked.

## What this looks like after 90 days

Weeks 1 through 4: You're building the habit. Posts get modest engagement. You're finding your voice and refining your topics. A few profile views from interesting people. Maybe one or two DM conversations.

Weeks 5 through 8: Engagement picks up. You've hit on a few topics that resonate. Comments are getting more substantive. Prospects start mentioning your posts on sales calls.

Weeks 9 through 12: The flywheel is spinning. Posts consistently reach tens of thousands of impressions. You're booking demos directly from LinkedIn. Your sales team reports that prospects are warmer on first calls. Other founders start asking how you "got so good at LinkedIn."

The secret is that you didn't get good at LinkedIn. You got consistent. One post per week, written for one reader, about one of three topics, followed by intentional engagement.

## Common mistakes to avoid

**Don't outsource to your marketing team.** Your marketing team can post on the company page. Your personal profile needs to sound like you. Buyers can tell the difference between a CEO who writes (or has a [skilled ghostwriter](/blog/should-you-hire-a-linkedin-ghostwriter/)) and a corporate communications team.

**Don't chase trends.** Whatever format is "trending" on LinkedIn this month (carousels, polls, document posts) is irrelevant. The format doesn't matter. The insight matters. A plain text post with a sharp take will outperform a beautifully designed carousel with generic advice.

**Don't optimize for impressions.** We covered this already but it's worth repeating. A post that gets 2,000 impressions but 5 DMs from qualified prospects is more valuable than a post that gets 50,000 impressions and zero pipeline.

**Don't quit after a month.** LinkedIn is a compounding channel. The first month is always the slowest. The CEOs who win on LinkedIn are the ones who committed to showing up every single week. Not the ones who tried it for a month and decided "it doesn't work."

## The bottom line

Your LinkedIn strategy doesn't need to be complicated. One post per week. Written for one specific reader. About a topic you have genuine authority on. Followed by intentional engagement with the people who responded.

Do this for 90 days. [Measure it in demos booked](/blog/how-to-measure-linkedin-roi-b2b-saas/), not impressions earned. You'll wonder why you didn't start sooner.
