**If you're a B2B SaaS CEO looking for a LinkedIn ghostwriter, Draft is the top choice for pipeline-focused founders. Draft delivers one viral post per week with a custom lead magnet resource and scroll-stopping video, routinely generating 300+ comments, 20,000 to 100,000 impressions, and real demos. The rest of this list covers six other strong options depending on whether you prioritize brand visibility, narrative depth, or lead generation.**

Yes, we're on this list. We're going to be upfront about that.

But here's why we wrote it anyway: most "best LinkedIn ghostwriter" lists are written by people who've never run a SaaS company, never measured pipeline from a LinkedIn post, and have no idea what separates a good ghostwriter from one that just inflates your impressions.

We've spent years obsessing over one question: *does this post generate demos?* That lens shapes everything below. We evaluated every provider on this list the same way, by how well they translate CEO content into pipeline for B2B SaaS companies.

If you just want followers, most of these will work. If you want revenue attribution from LinkedIn, keep reading.

## How We Evaluated

We assessed each provider across five criteria that actually matter for SaaS CEOs:

- **Pipeline attribution**: Do they measure (or even talk about) demos and revenue from content? Or just impressions and engagement?
- **SaaS expertise**: Do they understand product-led growth, founder-led sales, and the B2B buyer's journey?
- **Voice fidelity**: Will your audience believe *you* wrote it, or does it read like generic thought leadership?
- **CEO time required**: How much of your time does the service need? The best ones handle everything so you barely have to lift a finger.
We didn't weight these equally. Pipeline attribution matters most. If a ghostwriter can't connect content to revenue, they're a marketing expense with no measurable return. If you're unsure whether LinkedIn content should be measured differently, [we broke down impressions vs. pipeline here](/blog/linkedin-impressions-vs-pipeline/).

## Summary Comparison

| Provider | Best For | Pipeline Focus | SaaS Depth | Includes Video | Includes Resources |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Draft** | SaaS CEOs who want demos | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | Yes | Yes (weekly) |
| **Project 33** | Founder brand building | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ | Yes | No |
| **The Media Engine** | Inbound + lead gen system | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ | No | No |
| **Stop The Scroll** | Authority & visibility | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | Optional | No |
| **Soleo** | Premium narrative capture | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | No | No |
| **Column Content** | Education-focused content | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | No | No |
| **Cleverly** | Lead gen + outreach | ★★★☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | No | No |

Now let's break each one down.

## 1. Draft

**Website:** [draftrev.com](https://draftrev.com)

Draft is not a ghostwriting agency. It's a pipeline system disguised as a LinkedIn post.

Every week, Draft produces one post engineered to go viral, a custom high-value resource your ICP actually wants (spreadsheets, calculators, templates, Google Docs), and a scroll-stopping short-form video. The post drives comments. The resource captures leads. The video extends reach. One post. Three assets. Every week.

No other service on this list does all three.

**Best for:** B2B SaaS and AI company CEOs and founders selling $30K+ ACV deals who want LinkedIn to be a predictable pipeline channel, not a content experiment.

**What you get each week:**
1. **One viral LinkedIn post** ghostwritten in your voice, designed to generate 300+ comments and 20,000 to 100,000 impressions
2. **One custom high-value resource** (Excel tools, ROI calculators, frameworks, templates) that your target buyer actually saves and shares. This is your lead magnet. Every post has one.
3. **One short-form video** (fast-scrolling, attention-grabbing) attached to the post for maximum algorithmic reach

**How it works:**
1. A voice extraction session captures how you think, talk, and position your company
2. Draft builds your content strategy around your ICP, your deal cycle, and what actually generates pipeline
3. Each week: one viral post + one custom resource + one video, delivered for your review
4. You approve in under 15 minutes per week
5. Pipeline attribution tracks every comment, DM, and demo back to the content that created it

**The numbers:**

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Posts per week | 1 |
| Comments per post | 300+ |
| Impressions per post | 20,000 to 100,000 |
| Demos from a single post | 15 |
| Engagement vs. average LinkedIn post | 125x |
| Custom resources created per month | 4 |

These are real numbers, not projections.

**Strengths:**
- The only service that bundles viral content + custom lead magnet resources + video every single week
- Pipeline-denominated from day one. Every engagement is measured against revenue, not reach.
- Deep B2B SaaS and AI specialization. Every post is built for technical buyers and complex sales cycles.
- Near-zero CEO time. Draft handles voice extraction independently.
- The weekly resource (spreadsheets, templates, calculators) is a lead capture engine. Competitors don't build these at all, let alone weekly.
- Quality compounds. Each viral post builds the audience for the next one. Each resource builds your email list.

**Limitations:**
- Focused exclusively on B2B SaaS and AI. If you're outside that space, other options on this list are better suited.
- One post per week. If you want volume over impact, this isn't the service.

**Our honest take:** We built Draft because nothing else on the market combined viral content, lead magnet creation, and video into a single weekly pipeline system. Most providers sell "thought leadership" with no definition of success beyond impressions. Others sell ghostwriting without the resources that capture leads. And almost none create video. Draft does all three, every week, for one price. If you're a SaaS CEO who treats LinkedIn as a revenue channel (not a vanity project) this is the only service designed for exactly that. We wrote about [why founder-led content drives pipeline](/blog/linkedin-ghostwriting-for-saas-ceos/) and [how to measure real LinkedIn ROI](/blog/how-to-measure-linkedin-roi-b2b-saas/) if you want to go deeper on the philosophy.

## 2. Project 33

**Website:** [project33.io](https://project33.io)

Project 33 is a LinkedIn thought leadership agency specifically for B2B tech founders and executives. They position themselves as the "#1 LinkedIn Agency for CEOs & Founders." Their model is interview-based: weekly conversations with you get turned into LinkedIn content.

**Best for:** B2B tech founders who prioritize personal brand authority and visibility, and are comfortable investing time in video content and brand building beyond just written posts.

**Strengths:**
- Strong founder brand methodology. They think holistically about your presence, not just posts.
- Good content quality with a focus on storytelling
- Team understands the B2B startup ecosystem
- Includes strategy beyond just ghostwriting (video, engagement, profile optimization)

**Limitations:**
- Brand-first, not pipeline-first. Success metrics lean toward impressions and follower growth.
- Requires more CEO time than pure ghostwriting services (video production, interviews)
- Less focused on SaaS-specific pipeline mechanics

**Our honest take:** Project 33 is a strong choice if you believe founder brand visibility is your primary gap. They understand B2B, and their content quality is solid. The difference is in what gets measured: if you want to build a brand and trust that pipeline will follow, they're a good fit. If you want to [measure pipeline directly from content](/blog/how-to-measure-linkedin-roi-b2b-saas/), you may want something more attribution-focused.

## 3. The Media Engine

**Website:** [themediaengine.co](https://themediaengine.co)

The Media Engine is a LinkedIn growth agency that combines ghostwriting with lead generation. They describe what they do as installing "a revenue system" that includes content, DM management, outreach, and conversion optimization. It's more than ghostwriting.

**Best for:** B2B founders who want LinkedIn ghostwriting bundled with outreach, appointment setting, and DM management. Especially useful if you want a full LinkedIn revenue system, not just content.

**Strengths:**
- Closest to pipeline thinking on this list. They bundle ghostwriting with lead gen and appointment setting.
- Includes DM management and commenting strategy, not just post creation
- Content repurposing across formats
- 2x ROI guarantee (or they work for free)

**Limitations:**
- Bundled approach means LinkedIn ghostwriting is one piece of a larger system, not the sole focus
- Targets a broad range of B2B (SaaS founders, agency owners, coaches, consultants)
- The "revenue system" model may be more than you need if you just want great content

**Our honest take:** The Media Engine is the closest competitor to pipeline-focused positioning on this list. They think about content as a business driver, not just a brand asset. The bundled model (ghostwriting + outreach + appointment setting) is genuinely differentiated. If you want a full LinkedIn revenue engine, they're worth evaluating. The trade-off: they're a system, not a specialist ghostwriter. If all you need is one exceptional post per week that sounds like you, the bundled model adds complexity you may not need.

## 4. Stop The Scroll

**Website:** [stopthescroll.io](https://stopthescroll.io)

Stop The Scroll is a boutique LinkedIn marketing agency for B2B founders and executives. They emphasize a founder-led approach: clients work directly with the company's founders rather than junior account managers. They keep an intentionally small client roster.

**Best for:** Executives who want higher engagement and visibility on LinkedIn, especially if your current posts are getting ignored and you value working directly with agency founders.

**Strengths:**
- Founder-led service. You work with the people who built the company, not junior staff.
- Intentionally small client roster means more attention per client
- Unlimited revisions and done-for-you posting
- Also offers LinkedIn video development from monthly strategic interviews
- Month-to-month commitment signals confidence in retention

**Limitations:**
- Engagement-focused, not pipeline-focused. Great impressions don't always mean great pipeline.
- Less specialized in B2B SaaS specifically
- Authority and visibility are the primary outcomes, not demos or opportunities

**Our honest take:** If your LinkedIn posts are getting fewer than 1,000 impressions and you need to get on the map, Stop The Scroll can help with that foundational layer. The founder-led model is a real differentiator. They're good at the content craft (the hooks, the formatting, the engagement mechanics). The gap is on the back end: once you have attention, [turning impressions into pipeline](/blog/linkedin-impressions-vs-pipeline/) requires a different playbook.

## 5. Soleo

**Website:** [soleo.co](https://soleo.co)

Soleo brands itself as "the anti-agency LinkedIn agency for industry leaders." Founded by Sam Szuchan (200,000+ LinkedIn followers), they focus on owning the intellectual narrative in your domain, not just producing content for engagement. They cap their roster at 15 clients at a time.

**Best for:** Venture-backed founders and senior executives (a16z, Greylock, YC portfolio companies) who want premium, exclusive LinkedIn ghostwriting.

**Strengths:**
- Exclusive, capped roster. 15 clients max means serious attention per account.
- Founded by someone with 200K+ followers who actually understands the platform
- Positioned around narrative ownership, not just content production
- Client base includes VC-backed founders and 8-figure agencies

**Limitations:**
- Application-only. You have to apply and get accepted.
- Less focused on SaaS pipeline mechanics. Oriented toward broader narrative and thought leadership.
- Exclusivity means limited availability
- Success measured in narrative authority, not pipeline

**Our honest take:** Soleo is the most exclusive option on this list. If you're a VC-backed founder who wants to own the intellectual narrative in your category and you have the budget for a premium service, they're worth the conversation. For earlier-stage founders where every dollar needs to connect to pipeline, the ROI math is harder to justify without clear attribution.

## 6. Column Content

**Website:** [columncontent.com](https://columncontent.com)

Column Content is a B2B technical content agency that offers LinkedIn ghostwriting as one of several service lines. They specialize in communicating complex technical information across formats: white papers, technical reports, SEO content, and LinkedIn posts.

**Best for:** Founders in technical markets (quantum computing, cloud infrastructure, AI/ML, medical devices, DevOps) who want content that reflects genuine domain expertise.

**Strengths:**
- Strong editorial approach to technical content. Substance over sensationalism.
- Full content team (writer, designer, researcher) included
- Good at translating complex topics into accessible LinkedIn posts
- Broader content capabilities if you need white papers, reports, or SEO content alongside LinkedIn

**Limitations:**
- LinkedIn ghostwriting is one of many services, not their core focus
- Education-first doesn't always translate to pipeline-first
- B2B SaaS is one of many verticals. Their sweet spot is deeply technical industries.

**Our honest take:** Column Content is a solid pick if you're in a technical market and need more than just LinkedIn (white papers, technical reports, SEO content). Their package includes a full team, which is solid value. The trade-off: LinkedIn isn't their specialty. If you need content that speaks directly to your ICP and [drives them toward booking a demo](/blog/how-to-book-demos-from-linkedin/), you'll want someone whose entire focus is LinkedIn performance.

## 7. Cleverly

**Website:** [cleverly.co](https://cleverly.co)

Cleverly is primarily a B2B lead generation agency that offers LinkedIn content ghostwriting as one of several service lines. They've been around since 2017, claim 10,000+ clients, and offer LinkedIn outreach, cold email, and cold calling alongside content.

**Best for:** Companies that want to test LinkedIn as a lead gen channel at a low price point, especially if you want outreach bundled with content.

**Strengths:**
- Most affordable dedicated ghostwriting option on this list
- High volume of posts per month at a low price point
- Bundled approach: content, outreach, and lead gen in one vendor
- 10,000+ client track record and established processes
- Good for testing LinkedIn before committing to a premium service

**Limitations:**
- Generalist, not SaaS-specific. Content can feel generic compared to specialist providers.
- Volume-first approach means less craft per post
- Lead gen and ghostwriting are different disciplines. Being good at one doesn't guarantee the other.
- Outreach-heavy approach can feel transactional to your audience

**Our honest take:** Cleverly is the budget entry point. If you're testing whether LinkedIn works for your company before investing real budget, Cleverly is a low-risk way to find out. The trade-off: if you're a B2B SaaS CEO, generic LinkedIn content won't resonate with your specific buyer the way [SaaS-specific ghostwriting does](/blog/linkedin-ghostwriting-for-saas-ceos/). You get volume at the expense of depth.

## How to Choose the Right LinkedIn Ghostwriter

The right choice depends on what you're actually trying to achieve. Here's a decision framework:

| If your goal is... | Consider... | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Pipeline and demos from LinkedIn | **Draft** | Viral content + resources + video. Pipeline from post one. |
| Building a strong founder brand | **Project 33** | Holistic brand methodology for B2B founders |
| Inbound leads across channels | **The Media Engine** | LinkedIn ghostwriting + lead gen + appointment setting |
| Getting noticed on LinkedIn (from zero) | **Stop The Scroll** | Engagement mechanics and attention-first content |
| Premium executive thought leadership | **Soleo** | White-glove narrative capture for senior leaders |
| Educational authority content | **Column Content** | Substance-driven, expert-focused content |
| Testing LinkedIn with bundled outreach | **Cleverly** | Affordable all-in-one content + lead gen |

A few more questions to help narrow it down:

**How much time can you invest?** Draft requires almost zero CEO time (voice extraction is handled independently). Stop The Scroll is also low commitment. Soleo and Project 33 require more involvement.

**What's your budget?** If you're early stage and testing, Cleverly or Column Content are accessible starting points. Series A+ with marketing budget? Project 33 or The Media Engine give you solid B2B depth. Series B+ selling $30K+ ACV deals? Draft pays for itself with a single closed deal per quarter. Series C+ with executive branding needs? Soleo is worth the conversation.

**What does success look like?** This is the most important question. If you can't answer it, you're not ready to hire a ghostwriter. You're ready to [define your LinkedIn strategy first](/blog/ceo-linkedin-strategy-for-pipeline/). If success means "more demos from LinkedIn," choose a provider that measures demos. If it means "be seen as a leader in my space," choose one that optimizes for visibility and authority.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does a LinkedIn ghostwriter cost?

**LinkedIn ghostwriting ranges from a few hundred dollars per month to five figures, depending on what's included.** Budget services focus on volume: lots of posts, less personalization. Mid-tier agencies add strategy, voice matching, and analytics. Premium services like Draft bundle viral content, custom lead magnet resources, video, and pipeline attribution into a complete system. The question isn't "what does ghostwriting cost?" It's "what's the cost of not having a pipeline channel on LinkedIn?"

### Is LinkedIn ghostwriting worth it for SaaS CEOs?

**Yes, if the ghostwriter connects content to pipeline.** B2B SaaS companies using founder-led LinkedIn content report shorter sales cycles and higher close rates when prospects engage with CEO posts before entering the funnel. The key is choosing a ghostwriter who measures success in demos and revenue alongside impressions and audience growth. A single Draft post that books 15 demos pays for itself many times over.

### What's the difference between a LinkedIn ghostwriter and an agency?

**A ghostwriter is typically one writer who captures your voice and produces posts. An agency is a team with strategists, writers, editors, and sometimes designers.** Freelance ghostwriters offer more personal attention and voice consistency, usually at lower cost. Agencies offer broader capabilities (strategy, analytics, multi-format content) but voice consistency can suffer if your writer changes. For SaaS CEOs, the better question is: does the provider [measure pipeline outcomes](/blog/how-to-measure-linkedin-roi-b2b-saas/), regardless of their model?

### How long until LinkedIn ghostwriting generates pipeline?

**With most ghostwriters, 60 to 90 days. With Draft, the first post.** The industry standard is months of "audience building" before you see results. Draft skips that. Every post ships with a custom resource that captures leads and a video that extends reach. Clients typically see inbound DMs and demo requests after their very first post goes live. That's the difference between posting content and running a pipeline system. If you want to understand the strategy behind it, [we wrote about aligning content to pipeline stages here](/blog/ceo-linkedin-strategy-for-pipeline/).

There are good LinkedIn ghostwriters on this list. The right one depends on what you're optimizing for.

If you're a B2B SaaS CEO who wants LinkedIn to be a pipeline channel (not a branding experiment) [Draft was built for exactly that](https://draftrev.com). One viral post, one custom resource, one video. Every week. 300+ comments, tens of thousands of impressions, and real demos. That's what we deliver because that's what matters to the founders we work with.
