You've tried posting on LinkedIn yourself. Maybe you did it for a few weeks, maybe a few months. The results were inconsistent and it felt like shouting into a void. Or maybe you never started because you knew you wouldn't stick with it.

Now you're wondering if hiring a ghostwriter is the move.

Here's the honest answer: it depends. A ghostwriter is not a magic fix. But for the right CEO at the right stage, it's the highest-ROI investment you can make in your personal pipeline channel.

## What a LinkedIn ghostwriter actually does

Let's clear up the misconception first. A ghostwriter doesn't just "write posts for you." That's what a freelance content writer does, and it's why most CEO LinkedIn content sounds generic.

A good ghostwriter does this:

**Extracts your voice.** They spend hours learning how you think, how you talk, what you believe about your market. The goal isn't to write like a writer. It's to write like you, but sharper and more structured than you'd write yourself.

**Maps content to pipeline.** Every post ties back to a business outcome. Not "let's build your brand" or "let's grow your audience." Specifically: which buyer persona are we speaking to, what problem are we addressing, and how does this move them closer to a conversation?

**Writes and iterates.** Drafts go through review cycles. You approve everything before it goes live. Over time, the ghostwriter gets so dialed into your voice that the review cycle shrinks from 30 minutes to 5.

**Tracks what works.** Not impressions. Pipeline. Which posts generated DMs? Which ones led to demos? Which topics made prospects mention your content on sales calls?

The end result: every week, your network sees a post that sounds exactly like you. Because the ideas are yours. The ghostwriter just made them land.

## When hiring a ghostwriter makes sense

Not every CEO needs a ghostwriter. Here are the situations where it clearly makes sense:

**You're selling $30K+ ACV deals.** At this deal size, one LinkedIn-sourced demo can pay for months of ghostwriting. The ROI math is obvious. If your ACV is $500/month, the math is harder to justify.

**You know LinkedIn matters but can't be consistent.** You've posted sporadically. Some posts did well. But you can't maintain a weekly cadence because you're running a company. A ghostwriter solves the consistency problem without adding to your plate.

**Your sales team needs air cover.** Every cold email your SDRs send, the prospect checks LinkedIn first. If your profile has nothing recent, or worse, generic corporate content, you've already lost trust before the call. A ghostwriter keeps your presence alive and credible.

**You have strong opinions but no time to write them down.** Some CEOs have incredible insights about their market but will never sit down and write a 200-word post. A ghostwriter captures those insights in a 30-minute weekly call and turns them into content that builds pipeline.

## When it doesn't make sense

Be honest with yourself about these:

**You don't have product-market fit yet.** If you're pre-PMF, your time is better spent talking to customers than building a LinkedIn presence. Get the fundamentals right first.

**You can't commit 30 minutes per week.** Even with a ghostwriter, you need to provide input. A quick voice memo, a 20-minute call, or a review of drafts. If you genuinely can't spare that, the quality will suffer because the ghostwriter won't have fresh material to work with.

**You want a content agency, not a ghostwriter.** If you're looking for someone to also manage your company page, run LinkedIn ads, and build a content calendar across 5 platforms, that's an agency. A ghostwriter does one thing: makes your personal LinkedIn presence generate pipeline.

**Your expectations are unrealistic.** LinkedIn is a compounding channel. Post one generates awareness. Post four builds familiarity. Post eight builds trust. Post twelve books the demo. If you expect 50 demos from your first post, you'll be disappointed.

## What to look for when hiring

If you've decided it makes sense, here's how to evaluate ghostwriters:

**Do they understand your industry?** A ghostwriter who's written for B2B SaaS CEOs will ramp up in days. A generalist who's written for fitness coaches and real estate agents will take months and still miss the nuance. Ask them about ACV, pipeline metrics, and sales cycles. If they don't know what those words mean, keep looking.

**Can they show pipeline results?** Not impressions. Not follower growth. Actual pipeline. Posts that booked demos. Content that shortened sales cycles. If a ghostwriter can only show you engagement metrics, they're optimizing for the wrong thing.

**Do their samples sound like real people?** Read their portfolio. Does each client sound different? Or does every post have the same generic, polished tone? A good ghostwriter is a chameleon. A bad one has one voice that they paste onto every client.

**What's their process for voice extraction?** This is the most important question. How do they learn your voice? If the answer is "send us some bullet points and we'll write a post," run. If the answer involves recorded conversations, iterative feedback loops, and a voice guide document, that's a real process.

**How do they measure success?** If they report on impressions and follower growth, they're a social media manager. If they report on DMs from ICPs, demos booked, and pipeline influenced, they're a pipeline partner.

## The cost question

LinkedIn ghostwriting for B2B SaaS CEOs typically ranges from $2,000 to $10,000+ per month depending on the scope and the ghostwriter's track record.

Here's how to think about the ROI:

If your ACV is $30,000 and your ghostwriter costs $5,000/month, you need to close two LinkedIn-sourced deals per year to get a 3x return. Most CEOs with a strong LinkedIn presence close far more than that.

Compare this to other pipeline channels:
- A single SDR costs $60K-$90K/year fully loaded
- LinkedIn ads for B2B SaaS run $50-$150+ per lead
- Conference sponsorships cost $10K-$50K per event

One post per week that consistently generates 300+ comments and books demos is, dollar for dollar, one of the cheapest pipeline channels available to a SaaS CEO.

## The bottom line

Hire a ghostwriter if: you're a B2B SaaS CEO selling $30K+ ACV, you know LinkedIn works but can't do it consistently, and you want pipeline, not followers.

Don't hire one if: you're pre-PMF, you can't commit 30 minutes a week, or you're looking for a full-service content agency.

And when you do hire one, judge them by the only metric that matters: did your pipeline grow?
