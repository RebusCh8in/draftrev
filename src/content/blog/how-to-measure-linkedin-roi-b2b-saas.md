Your CFO asks: "What's our ROI from LinkedIn?"

You pause. You know it's working. Prospects mention your posts on calls. Deals close faster when the buyer has been reading your content. But you can't put a number on it.

This is the LinkedIn attribution problem. And it's why most SaaS CEOs either give up on LinkedIn (because they can't prove it works) or keep posting on faith (because they feel it works but can't quantify it).

Neither approach is good enough. Here's a framework for actually measuring LinkedIn ROI in pipeline dollars.

## Why traditional attribution fails for LinkedIn

Before we build the framework, understand why your CRM doesn't capture LinkedIn's impact:

**LinkedIn is a "dark social" channel.** Someone reads your post on Tuesday. They visit your website on Thursday by typing in the URL directly. They book a demo on Friday through your Calendly link. Your CRM says "direct traffic." LinkedIn gets zero credit.

**The buying journey is nonlinear.** A VP reads 8 of your posts over 3 months. They mention your company in a Slack channel to a colleague. The colleague books a demo. Your CRM credits the colleague's Google search. LinkedIn influenced the entire chain and gets attributed nothing.

**Multi-touch attribution is broken for organic social.** Most B2B SaaS companies use first-touch or last-touch attribution. LinkedIn rarely gets either one because it operates in the middle and top of the funnel. By the time someone converts, they've touched 5 other channels.

Chris Walker estimates that 93% of LinkedIn-sourced pipeline goes uncaptured by traditional attribution. That means if your CRM shows $100K in LinkedIn pipeline, the real number is closer to $1.4M.

## The LinkedIn ROI Framework

Stop trying to force LinkedIn into your existing attribution model. Instead, build a parallel measurement system.

### Layer 1: Self-reported attribution (the most important metric)

Add one question to your demo booking form: **"How did you hear about us?"**

Make it a free-text field, not a dropdown. Dropdowns force people into categories. Free text lets them tell you the truth: "I've been following [CEO name] on LinkedIn for months."

This single field will reveal more about LinkedIn's impact than any analytics platform. When prospects tell you in their own words that they found you through LinkedIn, that's the most reliable attribution signal you'll ever get.

Track this monthly. You'll be surprised how often LinkedIn shows up when you actually ask.

### Layer 2: Pipeline influence tracking

Not every LinkedIn-sourced deal starts with "I saw your post." Some start with a cold email that got a reply because the prospect recognized your name from their feed. Some start with a referral from someone who's been reading your content.

To capture this, ask your sales team one question after every discovery call: **"Did the prospect mention any of our content or LinkedIn posts?"**

Track three categories:

**LinkedIn-sourced:** The prospect explicitly said they found you through LinkedIn. They reached out via DM, commented on a post, or cited your content as the reason they booked.

**LinkedIn-influenced:** The prospect came through another channel (outbound, referral, website) but mentioned seeing your LinkedIn content during the call. "Yeah, I've seen your posts" is a buying signal that means LinkedIn warmed them up.

**No LinkedIn mention:** The prospect didn't mention LinkedIn. This doesn't mean LinkedIn wasn't involved, but you can't count what you can't confirm.

### Layer 3: Leading indicators (weekly tracking)

These metrics don't measure ROI directly, but they predict it:

**Comments from ICP.** Count the comments on each post from people who match your buyer persona. Not total comments. Comments from decision-makers at companies that could actually buy. If this number is growing week over week, pipeline will follow.

**Profile views from target titles.** After each post, check who viewed your profile. Filter by the titles and companies you care about. A spike in profile views from VPs at Series B SaaS companies means your content is landing.

**Inbound DMs from qualified prospects.** This is the most direct leading indicator. A DM from someone in your ICP saying "loved your post, would love to chat" is pipeline in motion.

**Connection requests from target accounts.** When decision-makers at your target companies start connecting with you after a post, they're entering your funnel voluntarily.

### Layer 4: Revenue math (quarterly review)

Every quarter, calculate:

**Total LinkedIn-sourced pipeline:** Sum the deal value of every opportunity where the prospect self-reported or mentioned LinkedIn.

**Total LinkedIn-influenced pipeline:** Sum the deal value of every opportunity where LinkedIn was mentioned as a touchpoint, even if it wasn't the primary source.

**Cost of LinkedIn investment:** What you spend on ghostwriting, tools, or time. For a CEO with a ghostwriter, this is typically $3,000 to $7,000/month.

**LinkedIn ROI:** (LinkedIn-sourced pipeline + LinkedIn-influenced pipeline) / Cost of LinkedIn investment.

For most B2B SaaS CEOs posting consistently, this ROI is 10x to 50x. The channel is absurdly underpriced because most companies don't bother to measure it properly.

## What good numbers look like

After 90 days of consistent posting (one high-quality post per week), here's what healthy metrics look like for a B2B SaaS CEO:

| Metric | Healthy Range |
|--------|--------------|
| Impressions per post | 20,000 to 100,000 |
| Comments per post | 100 to 300+ |
| ICP comments per post | 10 to 30+ |
| Profile views per week | 200 to 500+ |
| Inbound DMs per month | 5 to 20+ |
| Self-reported LinkedIn attribution per quarter | 15 to 40% of pipeline |

If you're below these ranges after 90 days of consistent posting, the issue is usually content quality or targeting, not the channel itself.

## The dashboard

Keep it simple. One spreadsheet, updated weekly:

**Weekly row:**
- Post topic and date
- Total comments
- ICP comments (manually counted)
- Profile views from target titles
- Inbound DMs from qualified prospects
- Demos booked that week (with source)

**Monthly summary:**
- Total demos booked where LinkedIn was mentioned
- Total pipeline $ from LinkedIn-sourced deals
- Total pipeline $ from LinkedIn-influenced deals
- Cost of LinkedIn investment

**Quarterly review:**
- LinkedIn ROI calculation
- Revenue closed from LinkedIn-sourced deals
- Comparison to other pipeline channels (cost per demo, cost per closed deal)

This takes 10 minutes per week to maintain and gives you the data to answer your CFO's question with real numbers.

## The metric that matters most

If you only track one thing, track this: **demos booked where the prospect mentioned LinkedIn.**

Not impressions. Not engagement rate. Not follower count. Demos where someone said, in their own words, that your LinkedIn content played a role in their decision to take a call.

When that number is growing month over month, LinkedIn is working. When it's flat, something needs to change (usually the content, not the channel).

## The bottom line

LinkedIn ROI is real. It's just invisible to traditional attribution. Build a parallel measurement system: self-reported attribution, sales call tracking, weekly leading indicators, and quarterly revenue math.

When you measure it properly, you'll find that one post per week, written for your ICP and measured in pipeline, is one of the highest-ROI investments you can make as a B2B SaaS CEO.
